    "2. Enables **reproducibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enables **fact-checking**\n",

    "1. Example 2 is more professionally done and is considered to be more academic than Example 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Due to the citations and properly formatted references section that includes all of the pertinent information, one can validate the information given in the writing (e.g. the density of water at 30.0  °C).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consequently, the writing becomes more substantial and trustworthy since its information content isn’t just coming from the author, but also from several checkable sources."
