    "    - knowing what is state-of-the-art\n",

    "    - \"A machine requires precise instructions, which users often fail to supply\" [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Target**: to support science (doing research, data support and analysis)\n",
    "    - \"Scientists commonly use languages such as Python and R to conduct and **automate analyses**, because in this way they can **speed data crunching**, **increase reproducibility**, protect data from accidental deletion or alteration and handle data sets that would overwhelm commercial applications.\" [1]\n",
    "    - Create workflows to help do the research\n",
    "    - Create simulations (increasingly becoming more important in research)\n",
    "        - exploratory: for understanding raw data\n",
